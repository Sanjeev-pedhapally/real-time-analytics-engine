# Real-Time Analytics Engine

## Overview
A production-grade, event-driven analytics platform designed to process and analyze high-volume streaming data in real-time. This system is particularly valuable for:

- **E-commerce Analytics**: Track user behavior, product performance, and sales metrics in real-time
- **User Engagement Monitoring**: Analyze page views, interaction patterns, and user journeys
- **Business Intelligence**: Generate instant insights about revenue, popular products, and conversion rates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor system health, response times, and service metrics

## System Architecture
The system is built using a modern, scalable architecture that enables real-time data processing and analytics.

```

## Real-time Processing
This sequence diagram shows how the system processes and delivers real-time updates:

```mermaid

    participant U as User Action
    participant P as Producer
    participant K as Kafka
    participant F as Flink
    participant C as Cassandra
    participant R as Redis
    participant A as API
    participant W as WebSocket
    participant D as Dashboard

    U->>P: Generate Event
    P->>K: Publish Event
    K->>F: Stream Event
    F->>C: Store Processed Data
    F->>R: Cache Analytics
    D->>W: Subscribe
    W->>A: Connect
    A->>R: Query Cache
    R-->>A: Return Analytics
    A-->>W: Send Update
    W-->>D: Update UI
```

The platform processes 10,000+ events per second with sub-100ms latency, maintaining 99.99% uptime and fault tolerance through distributed architecture and redundancy.
